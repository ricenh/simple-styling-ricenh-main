# PROJECT 1: Simple Styling
## DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Beginner
### Overview
This project requires you to use some simple CSS styling.

### Instructions
1. Examine `ch4-proj1.html` in the browser. **Do not make any changes to this file.**
2. Edit the file `styles.css` by defining styles so that it looks similar to that shown in [Figure 4.41](4.41-completed.png). The steps below provide more details.

3. The `<body>` element has `top` `margin` of `0em`, `left` and `right` margins of `4em`, and a `bottom` `margin` of `0em`. 
4. The `font` for the `<h1>` and `<blockquote>` is `Roboto Slab` with a size of `2rem` and `1.25rem`. The `font` everywhere else is `Open Sans` with a size of `0.9rem`, `1rem`, or `1.25rem`.
5. You will have to adjust `margin`, `padding`, and `border` properties for multiple elements.
6. The links have the same `color` for visited and not-visited. For the two external links, you will need to add `borders` with rounded corners. You will also need to define hover so that the `background` `color` is `#a9a9ba`, and the text `color` is `#9f2042`.
7. You will have to make use of `text-transform`, `text-align`, and `text-decoration` properties.
8. Set the `width` property of the image so it scales to its container's size (use a `%` value).

### Guidance and Testing
1. CSS can be overwhelming at times. The instructions above break the task down into smaller steps. Test each step along the way in a browser.
2. When completed, test at different browser sizes.
